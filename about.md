What motivated me to start this page is my need to convey information in the simplest way possible.

 My principle is to take a topic and deconstruct its technicalities, breaking down complex terminologies into simple English words. My biggest complaint was that academics tend to impress people with their vocabulary and their jargon, instead of attempting to communicate their ideas to people who are interested in the technical details. In my opinion, somewhere between the lines, the meaning is lost under the thick layers of grammar and vocabulary complications added by the authors.Personally, this made me struggle to understand the motivation behind an academic paper, let alone try to implement it, which often ended in disappointment. This disappointment demotivated me, resulting in numerous gaps in my GitHub account or experimenting with the field of deep learning.

However, the blog's main goal is not to hate on academics. My goal is to make people understand. Making a person with no PhD background understand an advanced concept in machine learning and computer vision is like opening up a new world to them. Not only is the receiver rewarded with new knowledge and comprehension, but it also allows me to become a teacher, improving my own understanding as well.
