What motivated me to start this page is my need to convey information in the simplest way possible.

 My goal is to make academic concepts accessible, ensuring that complex ideas don't get lost in a sea of technical language. Academic papers often use language that hinders understanding; my work aims to decode this complexity. I've encountered obstacles in understanding academic papers, but this frustration has driven me to explore deep learning and expand my GitHub portfolio.

However, the blog's main goal is not to hate on academics. My goal is to make people understand. Making a person with no PhD background understand an advanced concept in machine learning and computer vision is like opening up a new world to them. Not only is the receiver rewarded with new knowledge and comprehension, but it also allows me to become a teacher, improving my own understanding as well.
